Molecular dynamics-based free energy calculations using AMOEBA force field
and TINKER software; Absolute binding energies via full explicit solvent
simulations computed for each system; Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) used
to find free energy values; Statistical error computed from a standard
bootstrapping technique

Free energies computed via a window-based double decoupling method. About
40-50 total simulations were run for each ligand/guest; roughly half of them
to disappear the molecule in water, and half to disappear the ligand when
bound to the host. Initial windows were used to scale the multipole moments
and polarizability of all guest atoms to zero, followed by windows to scale
the vdw interactions between the guest and the rest of the system to zero.
All molecules were modeled as simple inclusion complexes of 1:1 stoichiometry,
with the exception of 2:1 complex simulations for G11 and G12 as described
below. A flat-bottomed harmonic restraint was used to keep each ligand inside
the host. The restraint range was chosen such that it was never violated
during an unrestrained host-guest simulation with the full potential. An
analytical correction was used to account for restraint removal in the fully
decoupled system.

Simulation windows were typically run for 10 ns. Molecular dynamics simulations
were performed in the NPT ensemble at 298K on NVIDIA 970 and 1070 GPUs with the
Tinker-OpenMM "DYNAMIC" program in "mixed" precision using a simple two-stage
RESPA integrator and a 2.0 fs time step for nonbonded terms and 0.25 fs for
valence terms. AMOEBA induced dipoles converged to an RMS change per atom of
0.00001 Debye via a DIIS method. Simulation systems were cubic boxes of about
40 Angstroms on a side. Free energies calculated via post-processing using the
Tinker 8.3 "BAR" program in double precision with error computed from a standard
bootstrap technique. The organic ammonium sites of all guests were protonated.
No extra ions were added to any simulations.

AMOEBA parameters for the host and all guests were generated standard
published protocols. Atomic multipoles were determined from MP2/6-311G(1d,1p)
and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations, except for oxaliplatin, which was generated
from large basis DFT calculations.

Based on comments in the originally provided SAMPL6 information, we explored
the possibility that G11 and G12 bind as 2:1 complexes with CB8. For G11 our
simulations predict that a second guest should not bind. For G12, we find
that a second guest molecule binds to an existing 1:1 CB8/G12 complex with
a binding free energy of -8.43 kcal/mol, which is very similar to the free
energy of binding of -8.33 kcal/mol for the first G12 binding to CB8 to form
the 1:1 complex. Note that we have submitted the 1:1 binding value of -8.33
in the above "prediction" section.
