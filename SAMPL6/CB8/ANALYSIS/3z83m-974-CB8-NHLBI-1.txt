Method: 
Parameters were developed using our own method. 
Partial atomic charges and the bonded parameters were generated using QM calculations with force-matching. 
Lennard-Jones parameters were obtained from CHARMM Force Field. 
Initial biding poses were determined via docking using GalaxyDock-HG. 
All simulations were performed with CHARMM.
Each system was solvated with ~3000 TIP3P waters in a cubic box whose dimensions were approximately 46 x 46 x 46 cubic Angstroms. 
Non-bonded interactions were truncated with a 12.0 Angstrom cutoff. 
Long-range electrostatics were handled with PME method. 
SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds involving hydrogen.
Simulation time step was set to 1 fs.    
Free energy calculations were done with Double Decoupling Method combined with Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Method(HREM)/Bennett Acceptance Ratio(BAR).
