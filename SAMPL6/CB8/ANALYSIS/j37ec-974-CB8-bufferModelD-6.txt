Method: 
The estimation of binding free energy of a molecule from Molecular Dynamics simulations is performed through the double annihilation approach by using the thermodynamic cycle. In the first step, called discharging step, the charges of the guest are turned off both in free phase (only the ligand) and in bound phase (ligand and receptor together), providing the discharging free energy changes. In the second step, called vanishing step, the guest becomes <<non-interacting>>, as the van der Waals terms are also switched off both in solvent and complex phase, giving the vanishing free energy changes in both phases.These steps are performed with a series of alchemical intermediate states based on a coupling parameter 0 < λ < 1. So we compute the binding free energy by subtracting the sum of the free energy changes in the bound phase from the sum of the free energy changes in the free phase. The above calculations will be referred to as Model A. In the final step, the ligand becomes <<non-interacting>> so a restraint is needed so that the guest does not drift out from the host’s binding site. For this reason, a flat-bottom restraining potential is used between one atom of the ligand that is the closest to the center of mass and four equivalent atoms of the host and it is added to the potential energy function of the system.

The second set of simulation modelled the 10mM sodium phosphate buffer with NaCl by replicating the ionic strength. This results in 60 mM of NaCl to mimic 10mM of Na3PO4, thus 4 Na and 4 Cl were added to each CB8 system. Initially buffer was added to the bound phase systems and then the equilibration protocol that was used above was run. The solvated guest files were created by substituting the host’s heavy atoms with water molecules, to keep the same box size between both system files and the same NaCl concentration.

For the discharging step, 9 equidistant λ windows were used for the bound and the free phase, while for the free vanishing step 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations  in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process and for the bound vanishing step, 0.000, 0.050, 0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250, 0.300, 0.350, 0.400, 0.450, 0.500, 0.550, 0.600, 0.700, 0.850, 1.000 were used, in order to capture large fluctuations  in the free energy changes towards the beginning of the decoupling process. All simulations were run for 8 ns with Sire/OpenMM6.3 (SOMD) software (revision 2016.1.0), in an NPT ensemble and temperature control was achieved with an Andersen Thermostat with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. Pressure was maintained by a Monte Carlo barostat that attempted isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed with a 12 Å atom-based cutoff distance for the non-bonded interactions, using a Barker Watts reaction field with dielectric constant of 78.3.

Analysis was carried out using the multi Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR). For the better estimation of the computed binding free energy in terms of accuracy and stability, each simulation was repeated three times using different initial velocities drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So, the final binding free energies are calculated as the average of the three runs and the statistical uncertainties were computed using the standard error, which is the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of runs. The free energy method error was calculated as the the square root of the addition of the standard error computed above in the power of two plus the square root of the mean unsigned error in the power of two, as it was calculated for Model C in the SAMPL5 challenge for the OAMe systems.

In Model D, a linear regression correction as performed by combining the computational predictions in SAMPL5 competition provided by our group, and the experimental results provided by the organizers of the contest. This ad hoc implementation gives a final standard binding free energy equal to:

ΔGcomputational= a ΔGexperimental + b

Where a is the slope of the line and b is the intercept, the value of y when x=0. Through the results that they were obtained from the SAMPL5 challenge, the a and b parameters of the equation were calculated and the following equation was extracted:

ΔGcomputational,Model C =  a ΔGfit + b

Where ΔGcomputational,Model C is the free energy of binding acquired from Model C and ΔGfit is the new estimation for the free energy of binding by replacing the other known parameters of the equation.

The absolute free energies of binding obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:

Protocol A) No other additional corrections were performed.
Protocol C) A correction term for missing long-range dispersion interactions was evaluated for each guest in water and in the solvated host, and the difference was added to the free energy of binding. Also, a correction term for the use of the flat-bottom distance restraints was also applied to bring the decoupled guest to a standard concentration. This term was evaluated by numerical integration of the configuration integral of a potential energy function that solely contains contributions from the flat-bottom distance restraints.
Protocol D) A correction term through an ad hoc protocol. It is based on the comparison of the computational predictions in SAMPL5 competition provided by our group, and the experimental results provided by the organizers of the contest, combining them with linear regression
