Name:
SQM-opt
#
Software: 
Amber 16
Turbomole 7.0
COSMO-RS
#
Method:
Absolute free energies calculated with structures minimised with SQM/MM and then energies evaluated with PM6-DH+ + COSOM-RS solvation free energies + Frequencies from MM.

Ligands built by hand inside the host and then equilibrated for 100 ns.
10-20 equidistant snapshots were minimised by SQM/MM.
Single-point energy was calculated in vacuum by PM6-DH+.
Solvation free energies were calculated by COSMO-RS at BP/TZP level.
Frequencies were calculated on structures optimised freely with MM.
Thermal corrections were estimated from these frequencies (1 M reference state).
These three terms were summed for complex - host - guest.
The individual terms were Boltzmann-weighted to get a final free energy.

Force field GAFF2 and TIP3P. RESP charges from HF/6-31G* calculation.
Constant temperature (Langevin) and pressure (Berendsen).
Particle mesh Ewald with a cutoff of 8 A.
Time step 2 fs with bonds involving H constrained with SHAKE.

Ligand+host+4 water molecules (forming 2 H-bonds to each carboxylate atom) in QM system.
QM level PM6-DH+ (Amber software).
