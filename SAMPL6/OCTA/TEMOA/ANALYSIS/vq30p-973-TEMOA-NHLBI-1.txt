Method: 
Parameters were generated using CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) program.
Initial binding poses were determined by docking simulations (GalaxyDock-HG).
All simulations were performed with CHARMM.
Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble. 
Nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 12.0 Angstrom cutoff
whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the PME method. 
SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds involving hydrogen
and the simulation time step was set to 1 fs.
Free energy calculations were performed by using umbrella sampling simulations.
The reaction coordinate for umbrella sampling was set to the distance between 
the centers of mass of the guest and the host.
Force constant of the umbrella potential is set to 10 kcal/angstrom^2.
40 consecutive umbrella sampling simulations were performed by changing 
the center position of the umbrella potential.
10 indipendent umbrella sampling simulations were performed for the error calculation.
