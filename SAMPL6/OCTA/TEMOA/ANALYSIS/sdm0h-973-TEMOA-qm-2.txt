Name:
FEP-QM/MM
#
Software: 
Amber 16
#
Method:
Relative free energies calculated at QM/MM level of theory with FEP and the reference-potential approach. 
Force field GAFF2 and TIP3P. RESP charges from HF/6-31G* calculation.
Ligands built by hand inside the host.
Equilibrated 2 ns.
FEP calculations performed with 3-6 independent calculations.
Each with 13 lambda values (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, ... 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0).
1 ns equlibration and 2 ns production for each lambda value.
Constant temperature (Langevin) and pressure (Berendsen).
Particle mesh Ewald with a cutoff of 8 A.
Time step 2 fs with bonds involving H constrained with SHAKE.
Free energies calculated by MBAR using PYMBAR.
Absolute affinities obtained by using experimental data for caproic acid and caprylic acid.
Free energies at MM level corrected by a FEP from MM to QM/MM at the end states and four lambda values (0, 0.33, 0.66, and 1) with explicit QM/MM MD simulations.
Each with 0.5 ns equilibration and 1.0 ns production.
Only ligand in QM system.
QM level PM6-DH+ (Amber software).
