Molecular dynamics-based free energy calculations using AMOEBA force field
and TINKER software; Absolute binding energies via full explicit solvent
simulations computed for each system; Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) used
to find free energy values; Statistical error computed from a standard
bootstrapping technique

Free energies computed via a window-based double decoupling method. About
40-50 total simulations were run for each ligand/guest; roughly half of them
to disappear the molecule in water, and half to disappear the ligand when
bound to the host. Initial windows were used to scale the multipole moments
and polarizability of all guest atoms to zero, followed by windows to scale
the vdw interactions between the guest and the rest of the system to zero.
All molecules were modeled as simple inclusion complexes of 1:1 stoichiometry.
A flat-bottomed harmonic restraint was used to keep each ligand inside the
host. The restraint range was chosen such that it was never violated during
an unrestrained host-guest simulation with the full potential. An analytical
correction used to account for restraint removal in the fully decoupled system.

Simulation windows were typically run for 10 ns. Molecular dynamics simulations
were performed in the NPT ensemble at 298K on NVIDIA 970 and 1070 GPUs with the
Tinker-OpenMM "DYNAMIC" program in "mixed" precision using a simple two-stage
RESPA integrator and a 2.0 fs time step for nonbonded terms and 0.25 fs for
valence terms. AMOEBA induced dipoles converged to an RMS change per atom of
0.00001 Debye via a DIIS method. Simulation systems were cubic boxes of about
40 Angstroms on a side. Free energies calculated via post-processing using the
Tinker 8.3 "BAR" program in double precision with error computed via a standard
bootstrap technique. The organic carboxylate sites of guests were deprotonated.
Eight extra sodium ions were added to octaacid simulations resulting in a net
neutral host system.

AMOEBA parameters for the host and all guests were generated standard
published protocols. Atomic multipoles were determined from MP2/6-311G(1d,1p)
and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations.
