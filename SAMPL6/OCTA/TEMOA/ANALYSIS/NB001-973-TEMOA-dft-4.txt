Method:
Absolute free energies calculated with structures selected by SQM/MM and optimised by DFT and energies evaluated with DFT + COSOM-RS solvation free energies + Frequencies from MM.

Ligands built by hand inside the host and then equilibrated for 100 ns.
10-20 equidistant snapshots were minimised by SQM/MM.
Single-point energy was calculated in vacuum by PM6-DH+.
Solvation free energies were calculated by COSMO-RS at BP/TZP level.
Frequencies were calculated on structures optimised freely with MM.
Thermal corrections were estimated from these frequencies (1 M reference state).
These three terms were summed for complex - host - guest.

For the complex with the most favourabled binding free energy, structures were reoptimised by QM/MM (TPSS-D3/def2-SV(P).
Then energies were calculated in vacuum with TPSS-D3(BJ,abc)/def2-QZVP'.
Solvation free energies and thermal corrections were calculated as above.

Force field GAFF2 and TIP3P. RESP charges from HF/6-31G* calculation.
Constant temperature (Langevin) and pressure (Berendsen).
Particle mesh Ewald with a cutoff of 8 A.
Time step 2 fs with bonds involving H constrained with SHAKE.

Ligand+host+4 water molecules (forming 2 H-bonds to each carboxylate atom) in QM system.
MM system fixed in QM/MM optimisation.
No water molecules in energy calculation.
