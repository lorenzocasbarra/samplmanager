Method: 
All simulations were performed in explicit solvent and PBC with the
ORAC6.0 program (doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00151) using the fast
switching double annihilation method with no restraints.  (doi:
10.1039/c5cp05521k). In the REST stage (Replica Exchange with Solute
Tempering) we scaled the torsional and 14 non bonded interactions of
the solute (host+guest) from 1.0 (target state) down to 0.1
(i.e. equivalent to a maximal "torsional" temperature of 3000 K) using
eight replicas with the scaling protocol described in
10.1002/jcc.21388. Average exchange rate was 30%. The REST simulations
lasted (per replica state) 30 ns, sampling about 400 configurations
for the bound host-guest state and for the free guest in the solvent.
In the bound state, a weak COM-COM harmonic tethering potential
(k=0.026 kcal mol-1 Angs^-2 ) was imposed to prevent the guest
molecule from drifting off into the solvent. In the FS-DAM stage, the
guest, both in the bound and unbound state, was annihilated in 0.36 ns
in 400 independent annihilation trajectories starting from the points
sampled in the REST stage.  The annihilation Free energies of the
bound and unbound guest molecule were calculated from the work
distributions using in all cases the simple Gaussian estimate DG_ann=
<w> - beta*<sigma_w^2>/2.  The Dissociation FS-DAM free energy was
computed from the difference between the bound and unbound
annihilation free energies plus a standard state volume correction of
the form SSVC= k_BT ln (V_site/V_0) where V_0=1661 Angs^3 is the
standard state molecular volume.  V_site (i.e. the translational
binding site volume) was evaluated from the oscillation of the COM-COM
host-guest distance, sampled in the REST target state. Reported errors
on DG were computed by bootstrapping samples of 40 work values out of
the collection of 400 NE works.

The force field parameters and topology of the host and guests
molecules were prepared using the PrimaDORAC 1.0 web interface ( doi:
10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145).  PrimaDORAC uses GAFF2 and AM1/BCC charges
(see DOI: 10.1002/jcc.10128).  All carboxylate groups were assumed to
be deprotonated. No counterions were used.  A background neutralizing
plasma was assumed within the PBC Ewald method (PME). Each system was
solvated with ~1300 water molecular (TIP3 model) in a cubic box of ~34
sidelight. A finite size correction due to the net charges was 
calculated as described in DOI: 10.1063/1.477788.
  
Production simulations (both for the equilibrium REST stage and
non-equilibrium FS-DAM stage) were run in the NPT ensemble, with
temperature control (T=298 K) using a Nose-Hoover thermostat and
pressure control (P=1 atm) provided by a Parrinello-Rhaman barostat
with cubic constraints. Lennard-Jones nonbonded interactions were
truncated with a 13.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range
electrostatics were handled with the PME method using alpha=0.37 and 1
Angs grid spacing in the direct space.  SHAKE constraints were applied
to bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the simulations were integrated
using a five step RESPA integrator as described in
DOI:10.1021/jp960295w.
