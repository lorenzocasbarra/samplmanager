Method: 
The guest molecules were noncovalently docked to the host molecule using the docking
program of MOE 2016.08. The produced complexes were minimized under the Amber10:EHT
force field in MOE. The systems were then prepared using the Leap module of AmberTools16 under the
AMBER ff14SB and GAFF force fields. To create force field parameters, the geometry of the host
was optimized using Gaussian 16 with the AM1 method. The obtained AM1 Mulliken charges were used 
with the antechamber suite of Amber16 to generate AM1-BCC charges and parameters. 
Sodium or chloride counter ions, with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614),
were added to neutralize the system. Each system was solvated in a 14.0 Å cube of TIP4P-Ew water
beyond the solute and 150 mM sodium chloride.

The systems were relaxed under NVT conditions over six minimization procedures
with decreasing restraints on the host of 500.0, 200.0, 20.0, 10.0, 5.0 kcal/mol(Å ^2).
The systems then were heated to 300 K over 30 ps. The temperature was kept at 300 K using 
Langevin dynamics and pressure was coupled to 1 atm using isotropic position scaling.
Atomistic MD simulations were performed for 10 ns in triplicate. Nonbonded interactions
were truncated with a 10.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range electrostatics were 
handled with the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method, using default AMBER settings. SHAKE constraints were applied
to bonds involving hydrogen, and the simulation time step was set to 2 fs. All simuations were performed with AMBER16.7.

Cluster analyses were performed to identify the most representative structure for each host-guest complex. Free energy of 
binding was calculated for the first 50 frames of the trajectories using the Poisson Boltzmann model from the MMPBSA.py 
module of AmberTools and AMBER16.
