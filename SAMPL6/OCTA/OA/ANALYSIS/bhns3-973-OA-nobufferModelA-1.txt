Method: 
The estimation of binding free energy of a molecule from Molecular Dynamics simulations is performed through the double annihilation approach by using the thermodynamic cycle. In the first step, called discharging step, the charges of the guest are turned off both in free phase (only the ligand) and in bound phase (ligand and receptor together), providing the discharging free energy changes. In the second step, called vanishing step, the guest becomes "non-interacting", as the van der Waals terms are also switched off both in solvent and complex phase, giving the vanishing free energy changes in both phases. Furthermore, to prevent the ligand to drift off from the host cavity a flat-bottom restraining potential is used between one ligand’s atom close to the center of mass and four carbon atoms of the host. These steps are performed with a series of alchemical intermediate states based on a coupling parameter 0 < λ < 1. So we compute the binding free energy by subtracting the sum of the free energy changes in the bound phase from the sum of the free energy changes in the free phase. The above calculations can be referred to as Model A

SAMPL6 organizers provided OA mol2 files for host-guest systems.In these simulations, referred to as no buffer,  buffer was neglected and the force field parameters were extracted from the topologies provided by the SAMPL5 challenge. Using the system tleap, the systems were solvated in a rectangular box of TIP3P water molecules, with a cutoff radius between the solute and the box of 12Å. Ions were added to neutralize the overall charge of the box and the systems were energy minimized with the steepest decent procedure for 2ps and equilibrated in an NVT ensemble for 200ps at 298K, followed by an NPT equilibration for a further 200ps and a pressure of 1 atm using the Amber module Sander. Ultimately, 2 ns of NPT simulation was run with Sire/OpenMM6.3 software (revision 2017.1.0), in order to have a final density of about 1 g/cm3 using a timestep of 1 fs. The final coordinate files were retrieved with CPPTRAJ.

For the discharging step, 9 equidistant λ windows were used for the bound and the free phase, while for the vanishing step 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. All simulations were run for 8 ns with Sire/OpenMM6.3 (SOMD) software (revision 2016.1.0), in an NPT ensemble and temperature control was achieved with an Andersen Thermostat with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. Pressure was maintained by a Monte Carlo barostat that attempted isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed with a 12 Å atom-based cutoff distance for the non-bonded interactions, using a Barker Watts reaction field with dielectric constant of 78.3.

Analysis was carried out using the multi Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR). For the better estimation of the computed binding free energy in terms of accuracy and stability, each simulation was repeated three times using different initial velocities drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So, the final binding free energies are calculated as the average of the three runs and the statistical uncertainties were computed using the standard error, which is the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of runs. The free energy method error was calculated as the square root of the addition of the standard error in the power of two plus the mean unsigned error in the power of two, as it was calculated for Model A in the SAMPL5 challenge for the OA systems.
