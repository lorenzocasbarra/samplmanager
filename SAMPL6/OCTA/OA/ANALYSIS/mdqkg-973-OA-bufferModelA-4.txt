Method: 
The estimation of binding free energy of a molecule from Molecular Dynamics simulations is performed through the double annihilation approach by using the thermodynamic cycle. In the first step, called discharging step, the charges of the guest are turned off both in free phase (only the ligand) and in bound phase (ligand and receptor together), providing the discharging free energy changes. In the second step, called vanishing step, the guest becomes <<non-interacting>>, as the van der Waals terms are also switched off both in solvent and complex phase, giving the vanishing free energy changes in both phases.These steps are performed with a series of alchemical intermediate states based on a coupling parameter 0 < λ < 1. So we compute the binding free energy by subtracting the sum of the free energy changes in the bound phase from the sum of the free energy changes in the free phase. The above calculations will be referred to as Model A. In the final step, the ligand becomes <<non-interacting>> so a restraint is needed so that the guest does not drift out from the host’s binding site. For this reason, a flat-bottom restraining potential is used between one atom of the ligand that is the closest to the center of mass and four equivalent atoms of the host and it is added to the potential energy function of the system.

The second set of simulation modelled the 10mM sodium phosphate buffer with NaCl by replicating the ionic strength. This results in 60 mM of NaCl to mimic 10mM of Na3PO4, thus 4 Na and 4 Cl were added to each OA and TEMOA systems. Initially buffer was added to the bound phase systems and then the equilibration protocol that was used above was run. The solvated guest files were created by substituting the host’s heavy atoms with water molecules, to keep the same box size between both system files and the same NaCl concentration.

For the discharging step, 9 equidistant λ windows were used for the bound and the free phase, while for the vanishing step 11 equidistant lambda windows were used, and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process.. All simulations were run for 8 ns with Sire/OpenMM6.3 (SOMD) software (revision 2016.1.0), in an NPT ensemble and temperature control was achieved with an Andersen Thermostat with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. Pressure was maintained by a Monte Carlo barostat that attempted isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed with a 12 Å atom-based cutoff distance for the non-bonded interactions, using a Barker Watts reaction field with dielectric constant of 78.3.

Analysis was carried out using the multi Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR). For the better estimation of the computed binding free energy in terms of accuracy and stability, each simulation was repeated three times using different initial velocities drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So, the final binding free energies are calculated as the average of the three runs and the statistical uncertainties were computed using the standard error, which is the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of runs. The free energy method error was calculated as the square root of the addition of the standard error in the power of two plus the mean unsigned error in the power of two, as it was calculated for Model A in the SAMPL5 challenge for the OA systems.
