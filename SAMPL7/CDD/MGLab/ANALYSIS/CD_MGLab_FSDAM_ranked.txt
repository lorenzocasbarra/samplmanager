Method:

All simulations were performed with the ORAC6.1 program using the fast
switching double annihilation method (FSDAM) as described in doi:
10.1039/c5cp05521k. Briefly, in FSDAM the dissociation free energy is
determined in two consecutive stages: in the first stage (REST), the
bound and unbound state are sampled at full coupling using replica
exchange with solute tempering; in the second stage (fast switching,
FS), starting from the canonical sampling at full coupling, we launch
a swarm of independent and concurrent non-equilibrium trajectories
where the ligand-environment alchemical coupling parameter is rapidly
switched off to zero coupling (ligand in the gas phase). The
annihilation free energy in the two branch of the alchemical
thermodynamic cycle is recovered from the work distribution exploiting
the Crooks and Jarzynski non-equilibrium theorems.

The FF parameters (bonded, charges and LJ) and topology of the host
and guests molecules were prepared using the Primadorac interface (
doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145).  Primadorac uses GAFF2 and AM1/BCC
charges. Protonation states of guest and host molecules are predicted
by OpenBabel at pH 7.4.  No counterions were used.  A background
neutralizing plasma was assumed within the PBC Ewald method
(PME). Each system was solvated in about ~1000 OPC3 water molecules in
a cubic box of ~31 side-length. 

The initial configurations were prepared by molecular docking using a
SASA approach for implicit solvation, using the following scheme: the
guest molecule was inserted with random orientations by placing its
COM with uniform probability within a sphere of 6 Angs centered at the
COM of the host in the configuration provided by the organizer. Form
these randomly generated starting configurations ( 500 hundreds), the
system was minimized assuming full flexibility and SASA correction to
the local minimum using CG. The starting configuration for the
challenge is that with the smallest dissociation energy among the 500
docking runs with the R group of the guest molecule pointing upward 
towards the wider edge of the truncated cone. In six cases,
g2-24 g2-g35 g2-g36 g1-bcd g1-g09 g1-g35, we tested
also the other pose with the R group pointing downward on the narrow
edge, obtaining in most cases a negligible contribution to the binding
free energy.  

Production MD simulations (both REST and FS) were run in the NPT
ensemble, with temperature control (T=298 K) using Nose-Hoover
thermostat and pressure control (P=1 atm) provided a Parrinello-Rahman
barostat with cubic constraints. LJ non-bonded interactions were
truncated with a 13.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range
electrostatics were handled with the PME method using alpha=0.37 and 1
Angs grid spacing in the direct space.  SHAKE constraints were applied
to bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the simulation was integrated
using a five step RESPA integrator as described in
DOI:10.1021/jp960295w.

In the REST stage (Replica exchange with solute tempering) we scaled
the torsional ad 14 non bonded interactions of the solute (host+guest)
up to 0.1 (i.e. 3000 K) using 8 replicas with the scaling protocol
described in 10.1002/jcc.21388. Average exchange rate was 30%. The
REST simulations lasted (per replica state) 30 ns, sampling 480
configurations for the bound host-guest state and for the free guest
in bulk.  In the bound state, a weak COM-COM harmonic tethering
potential (k=0.026 kcal mol-1 Angs^2 ) was imposed to prevent the guest
to drifting off in the solvent. In the FS stage, the guest, in the
bound and unbound state, was annihilated in 0.36 and 0.24 ns,
respectively,  in 480 independent annihilation trajectories starting
form the corresponding points sampled in the REST stage.

Annihilation free energy estimates (bound and unbound states) are
based on the work distribution produced in the FS stage.  Before
processing the work distribution for the bound state, correlation
between work values and corresponding starting COM-COM distance was
checked to ensure that in none of the initial REST states the ligand
left the binding pocket (when this happens an outlier lower work value
is associated to an unbound state with outlier COM-COM distance). In
three cases (g2-35, g1-19, g1-36) we discarded a small fraction work
values corresponding to under-sampled secondary poses.

If the work distribution passed the Anderson-Darling and the
Jarque-Bera test, the annihilation free energy is calculated using the
Gaussian estimator. In this ranked submission, all estimates are based
on the Gaussian assumption as all distribution (bound or unbound)
passed the AD test normality tests after checking COM-COM distance
work correlation.

A finite size correction to the dissociation free energy due to net
charges has been calculated as described in DOI: 10.1063/1.477788.
The standard state correction to the dissociation free energy DG for
translational restraint is given by DG_ssc=RT ln(V_site/V_0), where
V_site (the binding site volume, see 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01192 ) is
computed from the variance of the guest-host COM-COM distances
monitored during the REST stage as V=4*pi*(2*\sigma^3/3) in the
primary pose.  Error on DG was computed by bootstrapping with
re-sampling in all cases.  Details of the various contributions to the
dissociation free energy DG are provided in the Table below (produced
by an application script processing the raw FS work data and raw
COM-COM REST time record).

Computational efficiency:

For each guest-host pair, the REST stage produced for the bound and
unbound state a total of 134.4 and 67.2 ns (16.8 and 8.4 on the target
state), respectively. On HPC system equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R)
Platinum 8160 CPU @ 2.10GHz (also known as "skylake"), the
calculation (8 REST batteries) required about 4 to 3 wall clock hours
using 384 cores (64 MPI process and 6 OpenMP thread for each
trajectory).  The FS stage produced a total 172.8 and 115.2 ns for the
bound and unbound state respectively, requiring about 1 wall clock
hour and using in both cases 2880 cores. The total cost of the
prediction for all the 16 guest-host pairs was 7833.6 nanosecond, delivered in
about 60 wall clock hours with jobs engaging from 1536 to 2280
cores. All calculations have been done on the Skylake-CRESCO6 HPC
platform in Portici (Italy) provided by ENEA.
