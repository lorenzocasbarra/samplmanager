Method:
All M.D simulations were performed in two step: 
1) Host and Guest Preparation, charged and solvated with AMBER programm using antechamber and tleap. The host and the guest are placed in the same box, but not directly connected in order to studied the connectivity of those two substructure over time.

2) With GROMACS: Minimisation in two step with Steepest decent algorithm and 100ps of equilibration are realised with md integrator.
Each system were solvated with ~2000 TI3P water in a cubic box whose dimensions were approximately 39 x 55 x 46 angstroms.
Production simulation were run in the NPT ensemble with temperature control using V-rescale thermostat at 300K and with tau_t = 0.1 and pressure control provided by Berendsen barostat. A cutoff-scheme=Verlet is used and the frequency to update the neighbor list is initially setted at 10 (nstlist is actually a minimum value and gmx mdrun might increase), whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the PME method with PME order setted at 4.0.

500ns of simulation are realised for the systems, with a snapshot every 0.1ps for a total of 5000 frames for all the simulations. For the guest considered as "linear" (NB: G01, G02, G03, G05, G12, G15, G16, G17), the inclusion process is realized in two times ; (1) surface contact interaction between host and guest and (2) a small modification of the initial host system, is followed by the entery of the guest "inside" the host system. For the guest considered as cyclic, the same method doesn't provided any results of interaction inside the pocket. But modifying the protocol in order to start from a fully open host sytem show a geometric optimisation around the cyclic host and perform finally similar interation as the linear system.

Those M.D are realised for the host G01, G02, G05 and G07.
Unfortunately, due to time limitation, we coudn't launch and analysed the other simulations.
For all the compound, host-guest interaction are also predicted using Docking algorithm as starting point to provide initial structure. The docking considered all the guest as fully flexible. In order to sample different conformations, three different docking grid are used in order to generate poses that represent for all the guest: surface interaction, interaction inside the cavity. In case that we had to restained the docking inside the cavity, a minimization is performed with MOE and CHIMERA softwares in order to prevent clash between host and guest.

The formal value of free energy of interaction are calculated with xtb-GNF programm develop by S.Grimme. Both Enthalpy and Entropy are calculated for all the systems. After further analysis, several structure are extracted from M.D simulations, giving us a dataset of different host geometry. From this dataset (~ 20 structures), a geometric optimisation is realized at semi empirical level using GNF2B basis set, and after verifying with hessian calculation that we have a real minima, the lowest energy structure is defined as reference for free energy calculation.

Based on the previous Docking and M.D results, several host-guest complex are optimised along GNF2B method, and as we have at least three different values for each host, in a similar way as previously described for the host, the lowest guest is defined as reference.
A visual inspection is also realized for all the host-guest complexes, and for several complexes the absolute minimum energy is not the one selected because the host were differing from the lowest host selected as reference.
