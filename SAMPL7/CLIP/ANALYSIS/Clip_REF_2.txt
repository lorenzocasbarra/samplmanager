Method:

Host and guest files in several forms (mol2,pdb, and sdf) were provided from SAMPL7 organizers via Github, and we utilized mol2. 
The protonation state(s) of each molecule were assigned with Chimera (1.13.1) at experimental pH of 7.4 and AM1-BCC charges were added 
using Openeye toolkits when necessary. The updated host and guest mol2 files were then processed and converted to PDBQT with 
AutoDock Tools (ADT 1.5.6). The ADT grid box feature by default identifies the grid center x_y_z coordinates of the hosts "binding
site" with a starting grid search box of 40 cubic Angstroms, and adjusted to fit the entire host. The grid box size and coordinates 
were added to relevant host-guest system script for docking with AutoDock Vina (1.1.2). In addition, our docking protocol had
a global search exhaustiveness of 100, and an energy range of 30 kcal/mol between the best and worst binding modes, all to generate
at most 100 binding modes. The grid center was placed at x_y_z coordinates 0.522, 26.377, and 23.956 respecitively. Upon docking 
completion, the pose with the highest docking score was selected for simulations. Upon completion, the docked guest PDBQT files were processed, 
inspected, and converted to PDB using PyMOL (1.7.4). Subsequently, the new guest PDB was processed, implicit hydrogens 
added, protonation states inspected, and saved as a mol2 with Chimera (1.13.1). 

Afterwords, openeye tools was used once again to perceive bonds, determine connectivity, and compute atomic formal charges. 
The host, guest, and complex files were parameterized, solvated with TIP3P water model in a cubic box approximately 41 x 41 x 41 cubic
Angstroms via AmberTools antechamber and tleap respectively. In addition to solvation, sodium and chloride counterions were added to 
neutralize the system and and additional ions were added to achieve the 20mM experimental concentration. The topology and coordinate 
files (with and without solvent) of the host, guest, and complex were saved as our simulation input files.

All simulations were performed with YANK (23.7) which uses OpenMM (1.7.1) as its simulation engine with CUDA platform in the University of California, San
Diego super computing cluster (TSCC). Explicit absolute free energy calculations were performed using the PMT method at NPT, with temperature 
control using Langevin thermostat at 298K and pressure control by Monte Carlo barostat at 1 atmosphere. Long and short range nonbonded interactions
were set at an 11 Angstrom cutoff, the edge of the solvation box 12 Angstroms away from any atom of host or guest, ewald error tolerance of 0.0001, 
and Lennard-Jones interactions turing on at 10 Angstroms. Harmonic restraints were applied to all systems to keep the ligand from migrating 
away from the "binding" region of the host, yet still be able to explore the area around it. (See naharm.yaml script) Electrostatic, steric, and restraint lambda values were
determined using YANKs automatic pipeline in a test run with bCD-g2. The lambda values were extracted and incorporated as our protocol for all systems
with a charged guest. 

An initial 500 ps simulation was used to minimize and relax all systems. The simulations contained 61 lambda windows runnning up to 30 ns per window in
an attempt to reduce the free energy prediction uncertainty below 0.5 kcal/mol. Total run lengths were adjusted on a system-by-system basis by monitoring the uncertainty associated with binding free energies as calculations progressed. The only exception was clip-g1, appeared to be converged by 26 ns. 

In our initial test similations we observed poor overlap between states and replica mixing for systems with charged guests when conducting the simulations with 29 lambda windows. This 29 lambda window protocol was also tested on a GDCC and Clip system (all have charged guests), and we observed poor overlap between states and replica mixing. In Clip systems, YANKs mixing statistics section of the simulation health report returned a warning. 
Therefore, we decided to include a separate protocol with additional lambda windows for systems with charged guests. The number of windows and the lambda values were determined using YANKs automatic pipline in a test simulation with bCD-g2, Clip-g11, and OA-g2. The values were extracted and utilized for all systems with charged guests as noted above.

NOTE-The majority of the guests that were docked to the "pocket" of the host were linear / aliphatic guests g1-g5, g12, and g16. The remaining guests, majority 
cyclic and aromatic, seem to interact with the "flap" and sulfonic acids on the surface of the host. Therefore, a separate experiment was run on clip-g11, where 
an open conformer of trimertrip was extracted, guest g1was docked and simulated following the same protocol.
