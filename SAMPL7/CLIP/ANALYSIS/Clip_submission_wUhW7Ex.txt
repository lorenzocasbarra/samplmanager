Method:

All simulations were performed with the ORAC6.1 program using the fast
switching double annihilation method (FSDAM) as described in doi-
10.1039/c5cp05521k. Briefly, in FSDAM the dissociation free energy is
determined in two consecutive stages- in the first stage (REST), the
bound and unbound state are sampled at full coupling using replica
exchange with solute tempering; in the second stage (fast switching,
FS), starting from the canonical sampling at full coupling, we launch
a swarm of independent and concurrent non-equilibrium trajectories
where the ligand-environment alchemical coupling parameter is rapidly
switched off to zero coupling (ligand in the gas phase). The
annihilation free energy in the two branch of the alchemical
thermodynamic cycle is recovered from the work distribution exploiting
the Crooks and Jarzynski non-equilibrium theorems.

The FF parameters (bonded, charges and LJ) and topology of the host
and guests molecules were prepared using the Primadorac interface (
doi- 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145).  Primadorac uses GAFF2 and AM1/BCC
charges. Protonation states of guest and host molecules are predicted
by OpenBabel at pH 7.4.  No counterions were used.  A background
neutralizing plasma was assumed within the PBC Ewald method
(PME). Each system was solvated in about ~1000 OPC3 water molecules in
a cubic box of ~31 side-length. 

The initial configurations were prepared by molecular docking using a
SASA approach for implicit solvation, using the following scheme- the
guest molecule was inserted with random orientations by placing its
COM with uniform probabilty within a sphere of 6 Angs centered at the
COM of the host in the cofiguration provided by the organizer. Form
these randomly generated starting configurations ( 500 hundreds), the
system was minimized assuming full flexibility and SASA correction to
the local minimum using CG. The starting configuration for the
challenge is that with the smallest dissociation energy among the 500
docking runs.

Production MD simulations (both REST and FS) were run in the NPT
ensemble, with temperature control (T=298 K) using Nose-Hoover
thermostat and pressure control (P=1 atm) provided a Parrinello-Rahman
barostat with cubic constraints. LJ non-bonded interactions were
truncated with a 13.0 Angstrom cutoff, whereas long-range
electrostatics were handled with the PME method using alpha=0.37 and 1
Angs grid spacing in the direct space.  SHAKE constraints were applied
to bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and the simulation was integrated
using a five step RESPA integrator as described in
DOI-10.1021/jp960295w.

In the REST stage (Replica exchange with solute tempering) we scaled
the torsional ad 14 non bonded interactions of the solute (host+guest)
up to 0.1 (i.e. 3000 K) using 8 replicas with the scaling protocol
described in 10.1002/jcc.21388. Average exchange rate was 30%. The
REST simulations lasted (per replica state) 30 ns, sampling 480
configurations for the bound host-guest state and for the free guest
in bulk.  In the bound state, a weak COM-COM harmonic tethering
potential (k=0.026 kcal mol-1 Angs^2 ) was imposed to prevent the guest
to drifting off in the solvent. In the FS stage, the guest, in the
bound and unbound state, was annihilated in 0.36 and 0.24 ns,
respectively,  in 480 independent annihilation trajectories starting
form the corresponding points sampled in the REST stage.

Annihilation free energy estimates (bound and unbound states) are
based on the work distribution produced in the FS stage.  Before
processing the work distribution for the bound state, correlation
bewteen work values and corresponding starting COM-COM distance was
checked to ensure that in none of the initial REST configurations the
ligand left the binding pocket (when this happens an outlier lower
work value is associated to an unbound state with outlier COM-COM
distance). None of the work values was discarded, after this analysis.
When the work distribution passes the Anderson-Darling and the
Jarque-Bera test, the annihilation free energy is calculated using the
Gaussian estimator. When the work distribution is found to be not
normal, the statistically boosted Jarzynski average is used,
exploiting the decorrelation between discharging work and
Lennard-Jones annihilation work (see P. Procacci, "Precision and
computational efficiency of non-equilibrium alchemical methods for
computing free energies of solvation. II- Unidirectional estimates",
JCP in press).  Error on DG estimates was computed by bootstrapping
with re-sampling in all cases. Gaussian estimates are more accurate
(when normality tests are passed) than Jarzynski boosted averages but
are less precise.  A finite size correction to the dissociation free
energy due to net charges has been calculated as described in DOI-
10.1063/1.477788.  The standard state correction to the dissociation
free energy DG for translational restraint is given by DG_ssc=RT
ln(V_site/V_0), where V_site (the binding site volume, see
10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01192 ) is computed from the variance of the
guest-host COM-COM distances monitored during the REST stage as
V=4*pi*(2*\sigma^3/3).  Details of the various contributions to the
dissociation free energy DG are provided in the Table below (produced
by an application script processing the raw FS work data and raw
COM-COM REST time record )

#Computational efficiency:

For each guest-host pair, the REST stage produced for the bound and
unbound state a total of 134.4 and 67.2 ns (16.8 and 8.4 on the target
state), respectively. On HPC system equipped with Intel Xeon
Platinum 8160 CPU 2.10GHz (also known as "Skylake"), the calculation
(8 REST batteries) required about 4 to 3 wall clock hours using 384
cores (64 MPI process and 6 OpenMP thread for each trajectory).  The
FS stage produced a total 172.8 and 115.2 ns for the bound and unbound
state respectively, requiring about 1 wall clock hour and using in
both cases 2880 cores. The total cost of the prediction for all the 16
guest-host pairs was 7833.6 nanosecond, delivered in about 60 wall
clock hours with parallel jobs engaging from 1536 to 2280 cores.  The
ORAC code was compiled with ifort17(Intel) using the -xCore-AVX512
compiler option for vectorization.  All calculations have been done on
the Skylake-CRESCO6 HPC platform in Portici (Italy) provided by ENEA.
