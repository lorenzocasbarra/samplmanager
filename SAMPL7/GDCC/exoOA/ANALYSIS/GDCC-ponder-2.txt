# METHODOLOGY

Method:
All simulations were performed with the Tinker and Tinker-OpenMM
software using the AMOEBA force field. AMOEBA parameters were generated
by the AMOEBA FORGE parameterization engine developed by Dr. Chris Ho
in collaboration with the Ponder lab. For each guest, a series of MD
simulations were run starting from the guest in water (solvation leg)
and from the host-guest complex in water (host-guest leg). In both
legs a series windows were used to first annihilate electrostatics in
the guest, followed by annihilation of guest vdw interactions. The
simulations were for 40-50 Ang systems, run under NPT, and with eight
sodium ions added to the host-guest runs to neutralize the host. No
other ions were added, and no attempt was made to neutralize the guest.
Simulations used PME for long range electrostatics, and a 9 Ang cutoff
on vdw terms incremented by an isotropic vdw long range correction.
A two-stage RESPA-style integrator was used for the MD with a 2 fs time
step. Trajectory snapshots were save every 1 ps. For host-guest MD,
a single flat-bottomed harmonic distance restraint between groups of
atoms was used to maintain binding of the guest. These restraints were
chosen such that they were not violated during long unrestrained MD
runs on the bound host-guest complex.

Each sampling window was simulated for 10 ns and the initial 1 ns was
discarded as equilibration. The 9 ns of production simulation for each
window were then analyzed using the standard BAR method between adjacent
windows to compute free energy differences. The difference between the
sum of the solvation and host-guest legs, after correction of the host-
guest sum for release of the flat-bottomed harmonic restraint, was
taken as the binding energy estimate. Statistical error was estimated
for each BAR calculation, and these errors were summed to get a total
error for each binding free energy prediction.

All 16 binding free energies were computed independently using two different
sets of AMOEBA force field parameters for the host molecules. These two
parameter sets differed almost entirely in two key torsional parameters
that control flexibility of the hosts through the middle of the cavity and
around the upper rim of the cavity. The predictions submitted here are from
calculations using exclusively OA (and analogous exoOA) parameters similar to those we have used for octaacid hosts in earlier rounds of the SAMPL exercise.
