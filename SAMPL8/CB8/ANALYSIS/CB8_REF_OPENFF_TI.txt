Method:

All simulations were performed using the attach-pull-release method (10.1002/jcc.23398, 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405) 
with pAPRika 1.0.4, and OpenMM 7.4.2 as the simulation engine. Fifteen windows were used for the attach phase, 
and the 46 umbrella sampling windows during the pull phase were spaced at 0.4 Angstrom intervals, starting at 6 Angstroms 
from the noninteracting anchor particles and extended to a maximum distance of 24 Angstroms. Fifteen windows were used 
for the release phase. Each window included up to 30 ns simulation time. 

The starting structures were obtained by docking using oedock from OpenEye Toolkits. Each host guest system were solvated
with 2500 TIP3P water molecules in a rectangular box hose dimensions were approximately 40 x 40 x 63 cubic Angstroms, sodium
or chloride counterions (with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614)) were added as needed to neutralize each
host-guest system, and additional NaCl ions were added to obtain experimental conditions of the same ionic strength. AM1BCC
partial atomic charges were generated with oequacpac as implemented with OpenEye Toolkits. The bonded and Lennard-Jones
parameters were assigned based on OpenFF v1.2.0 using the Openforcefield toolkit. 

The attach-pull-release windows were prepared using pAPRika 1.0.4, which consists of: adding non-interacting anchor particles, 
Boresch-style restraint setup, the addition of solvent and ions, and preparation of OpenMM XML files. 
As described elsewhere (10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405), six restraints (one distance restraint, two angle restraints, and three torsional
restraints) were used to position the host relative to the anchor particles throughout the entire APR process to impose a lab frame 
of reference. Moreover, three restraints were applied to the guest molecule; two for the translation (r and theta) and one for the
orientation (beta). The guest molecule is pulled from host along the reaction coordinate r.
The force constant values used for the host static restraints and the guest orientational restraints were:

distance restraints = 10.0 kcal/mol/A^2
angle and torsional restraints = 100 kcal/mol/rad^2

Host conformational "Jack" restraints were used during the attachment phase to facilitate sampling during the pulling phase, as
described in 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405. Eight distance restraints were used on the carbonyls of CB8 to enlarge the cavity and 
reduce energetic barriers when removing the guest out of the cavity. 
The force constant values used for the host conformational restraints were:

distance restraints = 14.0 kcal/mol/A^2
angle restraints = 13.0 kcal/mol/rad^2  

Eight "wall" restraints were used to help define the bound state and prevent guest molecules from leaving the host during the 
attach phase. Restraints were set on the guest relative to every other carbon of the two-carbon chain in each glycoluril unit.
The force constant values used for the wall restraints were:

distance restraints = 50 kcal/mol/A^2
angle restraints = 14 kcal/mol/rad^2 

Equilibration was done at a constant temperature of 298.15 K using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency 1.0 ps^-1 
and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (1 atm). All systems were minimized up to a maximum of 5000 
and equilibrated for 1ns.  

Production simulations were run up to 30 ns per window at 298.15 K with temperature control using a Langevin thermostat 
with collision frequency 1.0 ps-1 and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (at 1 atm). 
Nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 9.0 Angstrom cutoff. At the same time, long-range electrostatics were 
handled with the PME method and an isotropic dispersion correction is used for the long-range Lennard-Jones. The simulation 
time step was set to 4 fs with Hydrogen Mass Repartitioning (HMR). 

All simulations were analyzed with thermodynamic integration (TI) and/or multibennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator approaches.
The SEMs were obtained using block analysis (described in 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405).

Guests G1 through G7 have a titrable nitrogen with pKa values of 10.21, 8.77, 9.12, 9.08, 7.16, 10.56, and 8.85, respectively. 
Thus we considered protonated and non-protonated variants of the guests for binding free energy predictions. 
In addition, guests G3 (Morphine) and G4 (Hydromorphone) have two additional titrable groups (hydroxyls), which may need to 
be considered. Only three protonation state populations are possible at pH 7.4.  
 
Guest G5 (Ketamine) has a protonated and non-protonated state populations approximately 36.75% and 63.25%, respectively as
determined via chemicalize from Chemaxxon. The favored non-protonated Ketamine was confirmed with Openeye Toolkit, thus two 
simulations for CB8 with Ketamine were done. The calculated binding free energy of CB8 with a neutral G5
was -12.34 +/- 0.83 kcal/mol, -13.51 +/- 0.46 kcal/mol with a charged G5 (protonated), and -13.50 +/- 0.45 kcal/mol considering
both states. 

The nonprotonated states of G1 and G6 are populated 0.15% or less, likely only the protonated state may need to be considered.
Guests G2 (2 states), G3 (3 states), G4 (3 states), and G7 (2 states) have additional states populated at ~5% or less. 
The non-protonated variants for these guests were not considered but may be calculated in follow up investigations.
