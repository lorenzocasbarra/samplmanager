Method:

Starting structures were obtained by manual docking of the guests inside the cavity of the D8h CB8 host, taking care to avoid steric clashes. Different initial poses were created for replicate guest@CB8 calculations. All guest molecules and CB8-complexes were centered on the Cartesian origin. No buffer or solute counterions were used. All guests and guest@CB8 complexes were treated as 1+. 

Several of the guests (G2, G3, G4 and G7) have stereogenic nitrogen centres in the protonated state. In vitro, these centres are likely to rapidly invert so ITC experiments won't distinguish between them. However, N-inversion is unlikley to happen during the MTD conditions in this study so the two N-stereoisomers of these guests were constructed and treated separately. Only the stereoisomers with the lower free energy of each pair are reported in this submission.

GFN2-xTB semiempirical extended tight-binding meta- molecular dynamics (MTD) simulations with GBSA implicit solvation were performed using the -nci (non-covalent interaction) option of the CREST (Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool) driver program. The default CREST conformational search algorithm (iMTD-GC) makes use of extensive root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) based metadynamic sampling (MTD), with an additional genetic z-matrix crossing (GC) step at the end, for the generation of conformer/rotamer ensembles (CREs)

For each molecule in this work, the following workflow of GFN2-xTB calculations was performed, managed by CREST: 

An ellipsoidal wall of dummy atoms was created around the molecule or complex (centered in the CB8 cavity and typically of x,y,z radial extents approx. 30,30,25 Bohr), and an automatically generated polynomial potential applied to prevent host-guest dissociation.

Six independent 10ps MTD runs were performed (at 300K, with 5fs timesteps, Berendsen thermostat and SHAKE constraints on all bonds, H mass = 2 amu), each with different, automatically chosen, settings of a history-dependent Gaussian-type biasing potential. Structure snapshots were taken at 100fs intervals for each MTD run and these 600 initial structures were geometry-optimized in a multi-level, three-step-filtering procedure, by firstly applying two loose convergence threshold settings followed by very tightly converged optimization, with energy windows of 15, 10, and 6 kcal/mol, respectively. After the second step of this filtering, 10ps regular MD simulations were performed on the 6 lowest-energy conformers (at 400 K) to obtain any rotamers and to more extensively sample around the MTD minima, to find low-barrier conformers missed by the high-energy MTD treatment. In the last step, the GC procedure was performed to generate a working CRE. This process was repeated with another set of 4 MTD runs followed by the three-step filtering to find new conformer/rotamers to complement the working CRE. If a new lowest-energy structure was found by this MTD set, another cycle of MTD sampling & filtering was done, and the process repeated with this structure as the starting input, for a maximum of 5 cycles. In this work, no guest or guest@CB8 complex required more than 3 MTD iteration cycles to complete.

The final CRE found by the CREST workflow was subjected to a conformer/rotamer identification process to remove replicates, then all remaining structures were ranked by energy. Each of the structures within a 6 kcal/mol window of the global minimum were subjected to a vibrational frequency analysis to provide the entropy of the thermally accessible ensemble, and thus the free energy:  
G = Egas + δG(GBSA solv)+ G(RRHO) + 298.15 * S(ensemble)

This process was repeated at least once for every guest and guest@CB8 system, with different initial binding poses and random initialisation of the 10ps MTD runs, to obtain an estimate of the precison of the final free energy values. These replicates consistently produced free energies within better than ±0.2 kcal/mol of the average, so this value has been used as the free energy SEM.

In several cases, longer (20 or 30ps) CREST runs were performed to test the sensitivity of the ensemble membership and entropy on MTD runtime. The ensemble entropies converge after 30ps to give free energies that differ by less than 1 kcal/mol from the 10ps runs. As a balance between computational runtimes and model accuracy, 10ps was chosen as the default MTD runtime.

During the 10ps MTD runs, all guests leave the CB8 cavity, resulting in a considerable number of surface-bound ensemble structures. However, the same lowest-energy structures were obtained from replicate CREST runs, with the guests bound within the CB8 cavity in all cases, and the protonated ammonium substituents H-bonded to at least one portal oxygen.  

Binding free energies were calculated as the difference between the free energy of the solvated guest@CB8 ensemble of all structures within a 6kcal/mol window of the global minimum (as above), and the sum of the free energies of the corresponding ensembles of solvated free guest and solvated CB8. In the case of free solvated CB8, the lowest enegy structure has D8h symmetry, and there is only one other structure within the 6kcal/mol window (3.44 kcal/mol above the D8h rminimum) so the D8h structure accounts for more than 99% of the population of free CB8 (assuming no protonation of CB8). In contrast, the free guests are much more conformationally flexible and only G3 and G4 have 6kcal/mol ensembles for which the global minumum structure accounts for more that 90% of the population. G2 is the most flexible, with 99 structures in its 6kcal/mol final ensemble in a 20ps simulation of the free guest. Bound guest@CB8 complexes have similar ensemble characteristics to the free guests. 

In the case of G1, two molecules can be accommodated in the CB8 cavity, in opposing orientations, each with ammonium interactions to portal Oxygens, and with the phenyl-rings of the two guests facially aligned within the cavity. Stepwise binding free energies for the first and second G1 guests were calculated, as above, to be -12.0 and -10.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

Identical calculations were performed for protonated cycloheptanamine (G8) and cyclooctanamine (G9) guests, for which experimental binding free energies with CB8 are available from the SAMPL6 CB8 binding challenge: -8.34 and -10.0 kcal/mol respectively. The corresponding free energies from this work are -9.63 and -9.42 kcal/mol. The average unsigned deviation from experiment (1.0 kcal/mol) was used as an estimate of the free energy model uncertainty.
