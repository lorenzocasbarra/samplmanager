Method:
All simulations were conducted with the GROMACS 2016.4 program patched to the
free-energy library PLUMED 2.4.2 for restraints definition. Free-energy profiles
were constructed from the time series of a single order parameter sampled 
via umbrella sampling. The order parameter is given by the projection of the  
instantaneous separation vector between the centers of mass (COM) of the binding 
partners onto the host's instantaneous symmetry axis and was sampled between 
-2 and +2 nm in steps of 0.1 nm and using a force constant of 4000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 
for keeping the ligand in the respective umbrella window. 
Lateral movement of the ligand at every umbrella window
was restricted with the aid of a flat-bottom potential acting
on the orthogonal displacement of the ligand's COM from the host's 
molecular axis. The flat bottom width was chosen such that no force 
was acting on the bound ligand. 
The host's orientation was aligned along the z-axis of the simulation box
alongside with a translational restraint (500 kJ mol^-1 nm1-2) to keep its COM close
to the box center. The order parameter was written to file every 100 steps.
To facilitate configurational sampling, a Hamiltonian replica exchange  
scheme was used that attempts an exchange move between neighboring 
umbrella windows every 1000 steps. 

Each sampling window included a minimum of 40 ns simulation time.
The bonded and Lennard-Jones parameters were obtained from GAFF. 
Partial atomic charges were generated with the AM1-BCC approach as implemented in the 
program Antechamber. Chloride counterions, with parameters from
Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614), were added only as needed to
neutralize the total charge of each host-guest system; no additional
counterions were added. The starting structures were obtained from the 
SAMPL8 GitHub repository. Each system was solvated with ~2000 TIP3P waters in an
orthorhombic box whose dimensions were approximately 36 x 36 x 52
cubic Angstroms. 

Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperature control
using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency of 1.0 ps^-1
and Parrinello-Rahman barostat with coupling constant tau_p = 2.0 ps. 
A Verlet-buffered neighbor list which was updated every 40 steps, was applied
for the treatment of short-range electrostatic and van der
Waals interactions with potentials shifted to zero at 0.9 nm.
The latter were modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential. Analytic
dispersion corrections were applied for energy and
pressure calculation. Long-range electrostatic interactions
were treated with the smooth particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
method using a real-space cut-off of 0.9 nm with
a cubic splines interpolation scheme and a grid spacing of
0.1 nm. The center of mass translation of the computational box was removed
every 100 steps. All bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained using
the SHAKE algorithm with a relative tolerance of 0.0001.

Free energy profiles were analyzed using the umbrella integration (UI) method 
and compared to results from the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) 
which showed no substantial differences.

If a free energy offset between the two flat bulk water regions of the free energy profiles 
was present, it was found to be small (below 2 kcal/mol) compared to the global well depth in 
all cases, except for the largest ligand G2 (~ 8.4 kcal/mol), probably pointing towards 
non-sufficient sampling. In cases for which the offset exceeded the thermal noise threshold 
(= RT), binding free energies were calculated from free energy profiles estimated with 
the modified WHAM algorithm of Hub et al. (10.1021/ct100494z), using an additional 
constraint to suppress such offsets.

For the given concentration of sodium phosphate buffer of 20 mM we estimated 
the concentration of H2PO4(-) and HPO4(2-) at pH 7.4 by means of the Henderson-Hasselbalch 
equation using an available online tool,

https://www.egr.msu.edu/~scb-group-web/buffers/buffers.html

resulting in concentrations of 5.402 mM and 14.60 mM, respectively. 
Since a molecular model for the divalent ion was not readily available 
we estimated the amount of NaCl needed to obtain the same ionic strength. 
assuming that the buffer was prepared using NaH2PO4 (10.1080/10610278.2018.1516885).
However, the low numbers obtained (approx. 1 ion pair per 2000 water molecules)
raises the question of whether capturing the ionic strength is a rather
secondary effect for this dataset. Moreover, low ion concentrations 
may cause sampling issues (10.1002/jcc.20156).
Therefore, we decided to include only one Cl(-) counterion for 
the protonated guest molecules and lumped a possible error 
caused by not accounting for the ionic strength into a correction 
anyway applied to the raw MD data (see below).

Available pKa values for the seven ligands suggest that the protonated form 
of the molecule is the dominant one in a solution of pH 7.4, except for guest 5,
which has a pKa-value of 7.5, and therefore the concentration of the protonated form
is only marginally larger than that of the unprotonated form. 
For all guest molecules both the protonated and 
deprotonated form were considered in the binding free energy calculations. 
Reported is the value of the form with higher binding affinity, which is 
always the protonated form.
 
From the results of previous SAMPL-challenges and from own test calculations 
using guest molecules of known binding affinity, it became evident that the used
force field overestimates binding substantially. Therefore, the raw
binding free energy values were corrected empirically using a linear 
model trained on 5 guest molecules with known binding affinity towards CB8 such that

DG_pred = DG_raw - DG_corr

The correction term DG_corr was described as 

DG_corr = N_heavy^eff*(<V_hg^vdW>/(D_ASA)*alpha)+beta*TPA

with:

N_heavy^eff: Number of heavy atoms that effectively interact with the host molecule
<V_hg^vdw>: average short-range LJ interactions between host and guest in PMF minimum
D_ASA: change in solvent accessible surface area upon binding
TPA: topological polar area obtained from PubChem.
alpha: fit parameter 
beta: fit parameter
  
To calculate N_heavy^eff we computed the average short-range LJ interactions per heavy atom for
the training set comprising relatively small molecules that fit into the cavity.
For the larger SAMPL8 guest molecules we divided <V_hg^vdW> by the latter number.

The suggested correction model is likely to be very approximate. It is based on the observation
that in previous challenges binding was often overestimated. Our correction model distributes 
this overestimation across the short range host-guest LJ interactions and polar interactions 
represented by a simple descriptor.  

In our predictions, the reported model uncertainty does not refer to the  
raw data but to the corrected data based on the training set.
