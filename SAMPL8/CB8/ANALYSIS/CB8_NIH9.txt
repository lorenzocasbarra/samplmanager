# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "CB8" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CB8 challenge, G8 and G9 are not part of this challenge hence they will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:

Initial poses were obtained using a modified version of GalaxyDock. Parameters for the host were taken from a previous submission to the SAMPL6 challenge (force matching from B3LYP/6-31G* onto classical gas phase snapshots).
 For each residue (g1-g7), a 100 ns trajectory was generated using CHARMM with its c36 parameters. Snapshots were extracted each 10 ps. From these snapshots, psi4 software was used to generate wb97x-d/def2-svp gradients. Software package ForceSolve allowed us to generate one set of parameters per residue based on the wb97x-d gradients.
Subsequent simulations were then performed using openMM, with the force-matched parameters. A total of sixteen alchemical windows were run for each residue, soaked in a box containing TIP3 water with sodium and chloride ions in order to neutralize the system's total charge. The orthorhombic box was of approximate size 55*55*55 Angstroms, for both guests with and without the host.
For each window, 10 ns production was done in the NVT ensemble with a Langevin thermostat  and a friction constant of 5.0 ps-1.
For all guest-host systems, a restraining harmonic flat-bottomed potential was used to keep the centers of mass of the guest within 5.5 Angstroms of the host, with a 1.5 kCal.mol-1.A-1 constant. This was reflected in a free energy correction computed when the COM's distance exceeded the cutoff length.
10000 snapshots were extracted from the initial and final alchemical windows. wb97x-d energies were computed using the guest's coordinate, with the environment's (solvent and host) point-charges as an external potential provided for these calculations. This allowed us to compute the reweighting correction from our fully classical simulations to a system where the guests are treated using wb97x-d/def2-svp with gaussian blurring of 1 A on the classical region.
