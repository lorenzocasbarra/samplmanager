# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CB8 challenge, G8 and G9 are not part of this challenge hence they will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.

Method:
All CB8 systems were prepared from the provided mol2 files of the SAMPL8 challenge.
OpenEye toolkit was used to predict the most likely binding mode and to generate AM1-BCC 
atomic charges for CB8. Host and guests were parametrized with GAFF 1.8 and antechamber.
The complex and solvent phases were solvated in a cubic box with TIP3P water molecules 
with a minimun distance between the system and the box of 12 Å. A mass of 3 amu was used for hydrogen atoms. The system´s net charge was neutralized with one Cl- ion, and additional Na+ and Cl- 
ions were added to mimic the experimental ionic strength: 20 mM Na3PO4 were emulated with 120 mM NaCl. 
Joung & Cheatham JPCB (10.1021/jp8001614) parameters were used for the counterions 
Temperature was controlled using a Langevin thermostat and pressure control provided 
by the Monte Carlo barostat. Complex and solvent phases were minimized in 1000 steps, 
in the complex phase, single harmonic restraint was applied to keep the
guest in the binding site during alchemical transformation. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was used 
for long-range-electrostatic interactions with a cutoff of 12 Å. Lennard-Jones interactions used 
the same 12 Å and a switching distance was set up to 11 Å.
The spacing and number of intermediate states was determined automatically for all systems by the
traiblaze algorithm implemented in YANK. 

The equilibrated systems of the complex and solvent phase were
used to derive atomic charges of the guest molecule with QM/MM calculations of 100 snapshots from a 25 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Atomic charges were obtained from the electron density computed at the B3LYP level of theory with the def2-TZVP basis set (ORCA 4.1.0.; 10.1002/wcms.81) with the Minimal Basis 
Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method implemented in the HORTON package 2.1.0 (http://theochem.github.com/horton). The average of each atomic charge was replaced in the force field and the simulations were repeated until convergence in the atomic charge absolute value. The energy cost associated with 
the polarization of the guest in both phases was also calculated to subsequently carry out the
respective correction of the binding free energy. 

The free energy calculations and analysis were performed with YANK 0.25.0 replacing the AM1-BCC atomic charges of the guest with the new derived D-MBIS atomic charges. Binding free energies for host-guest systems were evaluated by means of a dobule annilation techique. Since all guest had
a net charge, a counterion of oppositive charge with the largest distance to the guest's initial position was selected and its interactions decoupled in parallel with the guest to maintain the box neutrality. 
LangevinSplittingDynamicsMove (BAOAB splitting, 4 fs timestep, 1.0/ps collision rate and 2500 steps/iteration) were used to sample configurational space in combination with the  self-adjusted mixture sampling (SAMS) with global-jump state update scheme. In total 40000 iteration of the algorithm 
for both complex and solvent phases was performed using the automated equilibration detection implemented 
in YANK (10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00784). The analysis of the samples was performed with the MBAR estimator. 
The free energy reported is the average of two simulations where the second simulation started with the same initial host-guest position but a different position of water molecules and ions. SEM consired error of the mean for the free energy and the polarization correction for both phases.
